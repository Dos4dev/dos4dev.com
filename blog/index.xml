      <description>System admin is important role in X-Road system. There a few documents contain information about system admin responsobility:
  An official statute.
  X-Road documentation.
  Agreement between security server owner and RIA
   To make it clearer I created a list of responsibilities:
  Archive the message log. The agreement with RIA is more precise about it.
  Setup the granted access policy rules.</description>

      <description>I am sure you have recognized that X-Tee has one more security server (SS), and yes, this is one I have launched :)
 I want to share with you a few moments that took me a bit of time to understand.
 At the beginning, I assume that you have already installed, registered SS and some of the data providers open to your endpoints.
 The first unexpected situation had to do with documentation.</description>
