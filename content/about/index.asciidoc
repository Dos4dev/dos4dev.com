I am a web developer with a passion for the digital society. The principle of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once-only_principle[`only once`] is the basis of E-Government, it means that people provide information only once, and it will be properly stored and reused instead of being re-provided. https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road[`X-Road`] is one implementation of this principle. I link:/blog[blog] about it from time to time.
