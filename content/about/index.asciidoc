I am a web developer, with a passion for a digital society. Society, where you have to take care of your ID card, phone, laptop and thatâ€™s it. 
I am a committer to https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road[`X-Road`] project, the core of the digital society. 
Occasionally, I link:/blog[blog] about topics related to my passion.
