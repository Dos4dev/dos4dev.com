I am sure you have recognized that  https://x-tee.ee/dashboard[`X-Tee`] has one more security server (SS), and yes, this is one I have launched :)

I want to share with you a few moments that took me a bit of time to understand. 

At the beginning, I assume that you have already installed, registered SS and some of the data providers open to your endpoints. 

The first unexpected situation had to do with documentation. I started using the https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide.md[`documentation`] from the repository to install SS, but I needed to use the https://abi.ria.ee/xtee/en/turvaserveri-haldus/turvaserveri-paigaldamine[`documentation`] from a government agency.
The difference is not that big, the repository documentation is more up to date.
 
Another difficulty was that my SS wasn't listening on public 80 port. I could only reach the application through localhost:80. 

The sollution was to override https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ug-syspar_x-road_v6_system_parameters.md[`proxy.connector-host`] value and restart the server.

[,bash]
----
systemctl restart xroad-proxy.service
----

After that I was able to publicly access the server with the curl command.

[,bash]
----
curl -d @request.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://my-security-server | xmlstarlet format
----

The last problem was related to the proper configuration of the SOAP request.


Here you can see an example of request body.

A couple of important moments. It's possible to use HTTP protocol for test requests, but only for test environment.

Please, keep in mind, you have to use TLS connection and close public access to 80, 443 and 4000 ports. 

The entire X-Tee infrastructure consists of three environments:

* Test
* Development
* Production

Test and development environments are quite similar, but RIK works only with *test* and production environments. 
I started with development env and have to switch to test env.

P.S. Happy distributed coding.
Many thanks for to the wonderful X-Road community and Estonian government auhtorities https://www.ria.ee/en.html[`RIA`] and https://www.rik.ee/en[`RIK`].
