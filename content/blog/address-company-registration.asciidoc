Address is a significant part of the request of the new company registration request.
This part has lot's of local details that is why I decided to create this document.

Here you can see a address part of the request. 
```
 <test:address>
                // location
                <test:asukoht>Lõõtsa tn 2a</test:asukoht>
                // ehak has to reference a specific part of Tallinn. The code has to match 4 digits 
                // from the ’koodaadress’ at 6-9 positions.
