This part described in the https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide.md[`documentation`], but one moment documentation of X-Road slightly different comparing with Estonian government https://x-tee.ee/docs[`documentation`]. https://abi.ria.ee/xtee/en/turvaserveri-haldus/turvaserveri-paigaldamine[`Third documentation], and the last but not least the government https://abi.ria.ee/xtee/files/en/12091395/19333123/1/1614085296736/The_data_exchange_layer_of_information_systems_regulation.pdf[act]. Research base on https://digikogu.taltech.ee/et/Download/dd3cc961-f8d4-453c-ae27-a17b13971292[E-shop`]\nI had two problems with before I made first test request.\nThe first, my SS didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to the public 80 port. I was able to reach the application only via localhost:80.\nThe second one is how to properly configure the SOAP request.\nThe first problem can be fixed easily. Need to override https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ug-syspar_x-road_v6_system_parameters.md[`proxy.connector-host`] value and restart the server systemctl restart xroad-proxy.service.\nVoila, now your SS is listening public ports and you can start to make test request:\ncurl -d @request.xml --header \u0026quot;Content-Type: text/xml\u0026quot; -X POST http://my-security-server | xmlstarlet format\nHere you can see an example of request body.\n\u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\u0026quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\u0026quot; xmlns:id=\u0026quot;http://x-road.eu/xsd/identifiers\u0026quot; xmlns:xrd=\u0026quot;http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:client id:objectType=\u0026quot;SUBSYSTEM\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt;ee-dev\u0026lt;/id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberClass\u0026gt;COM\u0026lt;/id:memberClass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberCode\u0026gt;1234567\u0026lt;/id:memberCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:subsystemCode\u0026gt;subSystem\u0026lt;/id:subsystemCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xrd:client\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:service id:objectType=\u0026quot;SERVICE\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt;ee-dev\u0026lt;/id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberClass\u0026gt;GOV\u0026lt;/id:memberClass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberCode\u0026gt;70000310\u0026lt;/id:memberCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:subsystemCode\u0026gt;arireg\u0026lt;/id:subsystemCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:serviceCode\u0026gt;nimeSobivus_v1\u0026lt;/id:serviceCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:serviceVersion\u0026gt;v1\u0026lt;/id:serviceVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xrd:service\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:userId\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/xrd:userId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:id\u0026gt;0ba036ea-d612-4e74-bf73-59a6f15627c8\u0026lt;/xrd:id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:protocolVersion\u0026gt;4.0\u0026lt;/xrd:protocolVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:nimeSobivus_v1 xmlns:test=\u0026quot;http://arireg.x-road.eu/producer/\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:keha\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:nimi\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/test:nimi\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:tapsusklass\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/test:tapsusklass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:keel\u0026gt;eng\u0026lt;/test:keel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/test:keha\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/test:nimeSobivus_v1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope\u0026gt; There you can see how X-Road community helps me to the define proper configuration of the SOAP request.\nhttps://jointxroad.slack.com/archives/CA66FG50T/p1635326519016400[`link to the slack conversation`]\nA couple of important moments. Yes, you can use HTTP protocol for test requests, but only for test environment.\nKeep in mind, you have to use TLS connection and close public access to 80 and 443 ports.\nAdditional fact about X-Tee:\nWhole infrastructure has tree environment:\n Test Development Production  Test and development env are the same and for each environment you have to have separate SS.\nP.S.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a selection of projects I have been involved with.\nDebezium:: https://debezium.io[Debezium] is a platform for change data capture; it lets you stream changes out of different databases such as Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB and SQL Server into Apache Kafka. I am the current lead of the Debezium project.\nQuarkus:: https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] is a \u0026ldquo;Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards\u0026rdquo;. My contributions to Quarkus are centered around its https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams[extension for Kafka Streams], which I initially created.\nJfrUnit:: https://github.com/moditect/jfrunit[JfrUnit] is a JUnit extension for asserting JDK Flight Recorder events. It comes handy for ensuring the right custom JFR events are emitted by a JVM-based library or application as well as for identifying potential performance regressions by tracking JFR events for memory allocation, network I/O, etc.\nkcctl:: https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl[kcctl] is a command-line client for working with Kafka Connect, allowing to examine the state of the Connect cluster and individual connectors, register and start/stop connectors, etc. It is based on Quarkus and provided as a native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows via GraalVM.\nModiTect, Layrry, and Deptective:: https://github.com/moditect/moditect[ModiTect] is a family of Maven and Gradle plug-ins around the Java Module System, e.g. for creating module descriptors and building modular runtime images via jlink. https://github.com/moditect/layrry[Layrry] is an API and launcher for modularized Java applications, leveraging the Java Module System\u0026rsquo;s notion of module layers, e.g. allowing to work with multiple versions of one dependency. https://github.com/moditect/deptective[Deptective] is a plug-in for the Java compiler (javac) for enforcing package dependencies within Java projects based on a declarative architecture definition.\nMapStruct:: https://mapstruct.org/[MapStruct] is a compile-time code generator for bean-to-bean mappings. Based on annotated Java interfaces, MapStruct generates mapping code that it is fully type-safe and very efficient by avoiding any usage of reflection. I was the creator and initial project lead of MapStruct.\nBean Validation and Hibernate Validator:: https://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation] is a Java specification which lets you express constraints on object models via annotations. Originally developed at the JCP, it\u0026rsquo;s now part of the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse foundation. I have been the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) and the lead of the reference implementation https://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Validator].\nOther Hibernate Projects:: As part of the https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] team, I\u0026rsquo;ve contributed to different projects such as Hibernate OGM (an effort to access NoSQL stores with JPA), Hibernate Search (full-text search for domain models based on Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch) and Hibernate ORM.\n","id":5,"publicationdate":"Dec 26, 2019","section":"","summary":"I have contributed to a wide range of open-source projects over the last years.
