This part described in the documentation, but one moment documentation of X-Road slightly different comparing with Estonian government documentation. Third documentation, and the last but not least the government act. Research base on E-shop\n I had two problems with before I made first test request.\n The first, my SS didn\u0026#8217;t listen to the public 80 port. I was able to reach the application only via localhost:80.\n The second one is how to properly configure the SOAP request.\n The first problem can be fixed easily. Need to override proxy.connector-host value and restart the server systemctl restart xroad-proxy.service.\n Voila, now your SS is listening public ports and you can start to make test request:\n curl -d @request.xml --header \"Content-Type: text/xml\" -X POST http://my-security-server | xmlstarlet format\n Here you can see an example of request body.\n \u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:id=\"http://x-road.eu/xsd/identifiers\" xmlns:xrd=\"http://x-road.eu/xsd/xroad.xsd\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:client id:objectType=\"SUBSYSTEM\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt;ee-dev\u0026lt;/id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberClass\u0026gt;COM\u0026lt;/id:memberClass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberCode\u0026gt;1234567\u0026lt;/id:memberCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:subsystemCode\u0026gt;subSystem\u0026lt;/id:subsystemCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xrd:client\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:service id:objectType=\"SERVICE\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt;ee-dev\u0026lt;/id:xRoadInstance\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberClass\u0026gt;GOV\u0026lt;/id:memberClass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:memberCode\u0026gt;70000310\u0026lt;/id:memberCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:subsystemCode\u0026gt;arireg\u0026lt;/id:subsystemCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:serviceCode\u0026gt;nimeSobivus_v1\u0026lt;/id:serviceCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id:serviceVersion\u0026gt;v1\u0026lt;/id:serviceVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xrd:service\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:userId\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/xrd:userId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:id\u0026gt;0ba036ea-d612-4e74-bf73-59a6f15627c8\u0026lt;/xrd:id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xrd:protocolVersion\u0026gt;4.0\u0026lt;/xrd:protocolVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SOAP-ENV:Body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:nimeSobivus_v1 xmlns:test=\"http://arireg.x-road.eu/producer/\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:keha\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:nimi\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/test:nimi\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:tapsusklass\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/test:tapsusklass\u0026gt; \u0026lt;test:keel\u0026gt;eng\u0026lt;/test:keel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/test:keha\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/test:nimeSobivus_v1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope\u0026gt;   There you can see how X-Road community helps me to the define proper configuration of the SOAP request. link to the slack conversation\n A couple of important moments. Yes, you can use HTTP protocol for test requests, but only for test environment.\n Keep in mind, you have to use TLS connection and close public access to 80 and 443 ports.\n Additional fact about X-Tee:\n Whole infrastructure has tree environment: * Test * Development * Production\n Test and development env are the same and for each environment you have to have separate SS.\n P.S. Happy distributed coding. Many thanks for to the wonderful X-Road community and Estonian government auhtorities RIA and RIK.\n   ","id":2,"publicationdate":"Dec 11, 2021","section":"blog","summary":"I am sure you have recognized that X-Tee has one more security server (SS), and yes, this is one I have launched.\n I want to share with you a few moments that took me a bit of time to understand.\n I assume that you already have installed, registered SS and some data provider expose for you endpoints.

Here\u0026#8217;s a selection of projects I have been involved with.\n  Debezium  Debezium is a platform for change data capture; it lets you stream changes out of different databases such as Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB and SQL Server into Apache Kafka. I am the current lead of the Debezium project.\n Quarkus  Quarkus is a \"Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards\". My contributions to Quarkus are centered around its extension for Kafka Streams, which I initially created.\n JfrUnit  JfrUnit is a JUnit extension for asserting JDK Flight Recorder events. It comes handy for ensuring the right custom JFR events are emitted by a JVM-based library or application as well as for identifying potential performance regressions by tracking JFR events for memory allocation, network I/O, etc.\n kcctl  kcctl is a command-line client for working with Kafka Connect, allowing to examine the state of the Connect cluster and individual connectors, register and start/stop connectors, etc. It is based on Quarkus and provided as a native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows via GraalVM.\n ModiTect, Layrry, and Deptective  ModiTect is a family of Maven and Gradle plug-ins around the Java Module System, e.g. for creating module descriptors and building modular runtime images via jlink. Layrry is an API and launcher for modularized Java applications, leveraging the Java Module System\u0026#8217;s notion of module layers, e.g. allowing to work with multiple versions of one dependency. Deptective is a plug-in for the Java compiler (javac) for enforcing package dependencies within Java projects based on a declarative architecture definition.\n MapStruct  MapStruct is a compile-time code generator for bean-to-bean mappings. Based on annotated Java interfaces, MapStruct generates mapping code that it is fully type-safe and very efficient by avoiding any usage of reflection. I was the creator and initial project lead of MapStruct.\n Bean Validation and Hibernate Validator  Bean Validation is a Java specification which lets you express constraints on object models via annotations. Originally developed at the JCP, it\u0026#8217;s now part of the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse foundation. I have been the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) and the lead of the reference implementation Hibernate Validator.\n Other Hibernate Projects  As part of the Hibernate team, I\u0026#8217;ve contributed to different projects such as Hibernate OGM (an effort to access NoSQL stores with JPA), Hibernate Search (full-text search for domain models based on Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch) and Hibernate ORM.\n   ","id":5,"publicationdate":"Dec 26, 2019","section":"","summary":"I have contributed to a wide range of open-source projects over the last years.
